# _Give the RFC a name here_

## Summary

_Write here a summary of the intended change to `jk`. Include the
principle benefit of adopting and implementing the proposal, and an
outline of technical changes needed._

## Example

_Include here a brief, illustrative example of using `jk` with the
proposed change._

## Motivation

_Explain here the motivation for the change -- what problem are people
facing that is difficult to solve with `jk` as it is?_

## Design

_Describe here the design of the change._

 - _What is the user interface or API? Give examples if you can._
 - _How will it work, technically?_
 _ _What are the corner cases, and how are they covered?_

## Backward compatibility

_Enumerate any backward-compatibility concerns:_

 - _Will people have to change their existing code?_
 - _If they don't, what might happen?_

_If the change will be backward-compatible, explain why._

## Drawbacks and limitations

_What are the drawbacks of adopting this proposal; e.g.,_

 - _Does it require more engineering work from users (for an
   equivalent result)?_
 - _Are there performance concerns?_
 - _Will it close off other possibilities?_
 - _Does it add significant complexity to the runtime or standard library?_
 - _Does it make understanding `jk` harder?_

## Alternatives

_Explain other designs or formulations that were considered (including
doing nothing, if not already covered above), and why the proposed
design is superior._

## Unresolved questions

_Keep track here of questions that come up while this is a draft.
Ideally, there will be nothing unresolved by the time the RFC is
accepted. It is OK to resolve a question by explaining why it
does not need to be answered_ yet _._
