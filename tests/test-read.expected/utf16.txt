This is some text that must be handled correctly, because it contains
non-ASCII text -- ‚Ç¨ -- that will encode to bytes differently in UTF8
(where it's E2 82 AC) than in UTF16 (where it's 20 AC).

If treated as just bytes, it will be in UTF8 when sent to JavaScript,
which will then decode it as UTF16 and get the ‚Ç¨ character wrong.

If explicitly encoded as UTF16 when sent to JavaScript, it will decode
it correctly, and write it correctly.

We also need to test characters that encode to more than one UTF16
word, like êê∑ (01 D8 37 DC).
