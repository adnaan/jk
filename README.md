# jk

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jkcfg/jk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jkcfg/jk)

> `jk` is still in very early stages. The standard library API isn't frozen
> and will most likely change. Feedback is most definitely welcome!

## jk - configuration as code

`jk` is a data templating tool designed to help writing structured
configuration files.

The main idea behind `jk` is to use a general purpose language for this task.
They offer mature tooling, great runtimes, a well established ecosystem and
many learning resources. `jk` uses Javascript and a runtime tailored for
configuration.

## Quick start

A good way to start with `jk` is to read our [introduction
tutorial][quick-start].

## More complex examples

- [A Kubernetes deployment written in Typescript][guestbook-ts]
- [Mutating objects with mixins][mixins-example]
- [Kustomize-like behavior][kustomize]

## Architecture & design

### v8

`jk` itself is a Javascript runtime written in Go and embedding [v8][v8]. It
uses Ryan Dahl's [v8worker2][v8worker2] to embed v8 and
[flatbuffers][flatbuffers] for the v8 ‚ü∑ Go communication.

### Hermeticity

While a general purpose language is great, configuration code can be made
more maintainable by restricting what it can do. A nice property `jk` has to
offer is being *hermetic*: if you clone a git repository
and execute a `jk` script, the resulting files should be the same on any
machine. To give concrete examples, this means the `jk` standard library
doesn't support environment variables nor has any networking capability.

### Library support

`jk` provides an unopinionated data templating layer. On top of the `jk`
runtime, libraries provide APIs for users to write configuration.

- [mixins][mixins]: build and compose configuration objects
- [kubernetes][kubernetes]: build Kubernetes objects

## Roadmap

This project is still in early stages but future (exciting!) plans include:

- Reach the state of having Kubernetes examples working and well documented.
- Work on hermeticity. (eg. [#110][issue110], [#44][issue44], [topic/hermeticity][issueHermeticity]).
- Native typescript support ([#54][issue54]).
- HCL support ([#94][issue94]).
